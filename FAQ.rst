Why another twitter client?
---------------------------

Because other clients didn't do quite what I wanted, or work on the systems
I wanted to use them on.

The closest I came to finding a usable client for my needs was gwibber_.  It
doesn't work quite right on my mobile devices though and there are a few bugs
that need fixing before I could use it on my desktop, but unfortunately the
source is on launchpad.

So, in the end writing ``bleeter`` seemed like the obvious answer.  It didn't
take long, does exactly what I want and works where I want it to work.
