title: Use Bayesian inference for notification timeout.
desc: |-
  I've been thinking it would be nice to have Up and Down buttons for
  notifications that trigger Bayesian learning for tweet text.  Higher guesses for
  new tweets would adjust the length of the notification.  This would make tweets
  that are likely to be more interesting last longer, and more likely to be read.
  
  Perhaps tweets with really low scores need not be displayed at all, but doing so
  would remove the ability to re-train the database.  Maybe there is a way around
  it?
  
  Or, is this just all kinds of stupid?
