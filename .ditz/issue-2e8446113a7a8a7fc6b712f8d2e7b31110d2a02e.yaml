title: The number of statuses to receive should be configurable.
desc: |-
  The default number of statuses received is 20, this should be configurable.
  This is especially useful for people who don't run the client very often(like
  me).  Given that only new statuses are retrieved this shouldn't any problems
  other than a huge backlog even for very high values.
