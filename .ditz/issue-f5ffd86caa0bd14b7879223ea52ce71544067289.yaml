title: Switch to Pixbufs for icons.
desc: |-
  In get_icon() you wrote:
  
    # If GTK becomes a dependency this would be better handled with
    # a gtk.gdk.Pixbuf object, until that day PIL is much lighter.
  
  There is already an indirect dependency on pygtk because of the notify-python
  usage.  If you switch to Pixbuf now I won't need to install PIL :)

    I use a notify-python compatible module that it designed for use with EFL and
    doesn't require GTK+ to be installed, as my main use for bleeter is on my ZipIt
    which has no GTK+.
    
    What I'm going to do though is create a fallback using GDK image manipulation,
    for people like yourself who don't have/want PIL.
