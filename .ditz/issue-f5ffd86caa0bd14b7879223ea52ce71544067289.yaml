title: Switch to Pixbufs for icons.
desc: |-
  In get_icon() you wrote:
  
    # If GTK becomes a dependency this would be better handled with
    # a gtk.gdk.Pixbuf object, until that day PIL is much lighter.
  
  There is already an indirect dependency on pygtk because of the notify-python
  usage.  If you switch to Pixbuf now I won't need to install PIL :)
