|modref| rebirth
================

Twitter_ became utterly uninteresting to me many years ago, as the people I care
about abandoned it for better places.  And that still hasn’t changed, in fact,
many things on twitter have clearly got far worse.

That said, the API exported by twitter has become a pseudo-standard for some
alternatives.  Which itself is a great idea, as it means many of the
excellent existing clients can be easily changed to work in a less hate fuelled
environment.  So, I’m re-raising |modref| entirely for the purpose of
interacting with those other services.

The future
----------

What does that mean?  Mostly, that I don’t care how well it interacts with
twitter_.  If you report a bug with a patch, I’ll gladly take it.  If you report
a bug without a patch, I’ll happily ignore it.

As of 2018-01-03, a branch exists that would break usage on twitter entirely,
but I don’t plan on merging it.  It doesn’t really clean things up enough to be
worthwhile, and it doesn’t make sense to just break the functionality for the
sake of breaking it.
