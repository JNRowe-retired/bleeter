h2. Introduction

@bleeter@ is a nasty little client for "twitter":http://twitter.com, currently very much in a *Works For Me* state.  It isn't intended to be used by others, but perhaps others will find it useful.

All it does is fetch your friends timeline and display notification popups for new tweets.  If your system's notification daemon supports adding actions to the popups then you'll be able to make a number of choices by clicking the buttons on the popup.

Most common notification daemons support actions, including "xfce4-notifyd":http://spuriousinterrupt.org/projects/xfce4-notifyd and Galago's "notification-daemon":http://www.galago-project.org/.

h2. Installation

@bleeter@ requires "Python":http://www.python.org/ and the following Python modules:

* "libnotify Python bindings":http://www.galago-project.org/downloads.php
* "configobj":http://code.google.com/p/configobj/
* "pygtk":http://www.pygtk.org/
* "tweepy":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tweepy/

The following optional packages will be used if available:

* "termstyle":http://github.com/gfxmonk/termstyle for coloured output in the terminal

If you're using "Gentoo":http://www.gentoo.org all these packages are available from either the main tree or "my overlay":http://github.com/JNRowe/misc-overlay.

@bleeter@ doesn't require installation to work as it is only a single "Python":http://www.python.org/ script.  If you wish to install it however, doing so it simple:

{% highlight text %}
git clone git://github.com/JNRowe/bleeter.git
cd bleeter
install -m755 bleeter.py /usr/bin/
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Usage

The first time you run @bleeter@ you should generate an "OAuth":http://oauth.net/ token using the @bleeter.py --get-token@ command.  Once you've generated an OAuth token running @bleeter@ will fetch your timeline and display new tweets in notification bubbles.  An example from my timeline could look like this:

If your notification daemon supports actions you'll have buttons that you can click as in the above screenshot.  The actions you can perform are:

* Clicking the notification bubble will open the tweet in your chosen browser[1]
* Clicking retweet will retweet the entry
* Clicking favourite will mark the tweet as a favourite[2]

If there are actions you often perform with tweets that aren't covered already, and that aren't too interactive, drop me a "mail":jnrowe@gmail.com or "file a bug":http://github.com/JNRowe/bleeter/issues.  The "too interactive" definition isn't set, so convince me!

Check the "FAQ":http://github.com/JNRowe/bleeter/blob/master/FAQ.rst#readme for answers to some comment questions, especially if you use Ubuntu or "e17":http://enlightenment.org.

fn1. You can change which browser is called by following the method described in the "@webbrowser@ documentation":http://docs.python.org/library/webbrowser.html.  Currently, the tweets are always opened in a new tab if your browser supports it but this may become configurable in the future.

fn2. This button is only available if the tweet hasn't already been marked as a favourite in another client.
